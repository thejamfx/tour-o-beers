# Tour of Beers

##Goals:
- Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of beers.
- Create Angular components to display beer details and show an array of beers.
- Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
- Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
- Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
- Enable users to select a beer from a master list and edit that beer in the details view.
- Format beer data with pipes
- Create a shared service to assemble the beers.
- Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.

###Task:
- Create an app with the following views:
    - Dashboard listing some selection of beers
    - List page listing all the beers (possibly with some details)
    - Detail page listing the details of a single beer
    - “Add beer” page to add any kind of good (Czech) beer
- Actions
    - you should be able to
        - Add a beer, its description and a picture (yes, picture is mandatory)
        - Remove a beer
        - Navigate easily between the screens

####It’s up to you to
- Create the design (should be basic)
- Create the views
- Create the routes and navigation
- Add action links where convenient
- Create the module / component structure

####Do:
- Create a public Github repository for this
- Use Angular CLI to generate the project, components, modules, ...
- Use Angular Material for as many components as possible
- Follow our coding standards.
- Write unit tests as per examples, including e2e
- Be creative - bonus points for bonus features
- Try not to follow the Tour of Heroes too much


####Optionally (more bonus points):
- Be responsive, use state-management system, service worker
