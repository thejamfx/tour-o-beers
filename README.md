Create Angular components to display beer details and show an array of beers.
Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
Enable users to select a beer from a master list and edit that beer in the details view.
Format beer data with pipes
Create a shared service to assemble the beers.
Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
